# Contacts Management App Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Contacts Management App

**Project Description**: The Contacts Management App is a web application designed by Ram Agrawal to help users manage their contacts efficiently. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contacts, authenticate themselves securely, and access their contacts from any device with an internet connection.

## SDLC Model

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model**: Agile

### Steps Followed:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - **Description**: Discussed project requirements with mentors to understand the scope and objectives of the Contacts Management App.
   - **Dividing Requirements**: Segmented requirements into distinct categories including technical, backend, and frontend aspects to streamline the development process.

2. **Design**:
   - **Description**: Created initial design mockups to visualize the user interface and overall structure of the application.
   - **Technical Architecture**: Outlined the technical architecture of the application, defining the interaction between frontend and backend components.

3. **Implementation**:
   - **Frontend Development**: Developed the frontend using React.js, incorporating Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
   - **Backend Development**: Built RESTful API endpoints using Node.js and Express.js to handle CRUD operations on contacts.
   - **Database Setup**: Implemented MongoDB database to store contact information securely.

4. **Testing**:
   - **Manual Testing**: Conducted manual testing by trying different scenarios and functionalities to verify the application's behavior.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Personally tested the application to ensure it meets the desired functionality and user experience.

5. **Deployment**:
   - **Version Control**: Utilized Git and GitHub for version control, regularly committing code changes and pushing them to the repository.
   - **Code Review**: Engaged in code reviews with mentors and peers to receive feedback and improve code quality.
   - **Deployment Planning**: Prepared for deployment by ensuring all necessary components and configurations are in place.
